<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Amy and I live in sunny South Africa. I have recently started my web development journey. Come to think of it, I have always had an interest in web design. 
  I had class at university where we had to create our own WordPress blog and it was fun experimenting with the style of the blog and creating the content for it.

<p>I lived in Asia for 6 years and I loved learning about other cultures and people. Working with people with different viewpoints and creativity outlets, was such a thrill.
I definitely learnt how to think on my feet but more importantly how to ask for help since we can't do things in isolation.

<p>If the pandemic has taught me anything, it's that if there is a will there is a way. People were getting things done from their living rooms.
  Proving that they are capable of practically anything.
